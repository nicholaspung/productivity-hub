      Welcome to myexperiment.life. This is a place to store high-level
      productivity tools for use. Pick and choose which tool you want to use and
      see if it helps you achieve your goals. If it doesn't help, stop using it,
      and try another. Life's an experiment. Find out what helps you achieve
      your goals.

    <p>Habit Tracker</p>
    <p>
      Helps manage and track the habits you are trying to build. Studies show
      that it takes on average 66 days to build a habit, but that's just an
      average. It may take 2 days to maybe never. Use this to visually track the
      habit you are trying to build, or make it a practice you strive to achieve
      every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also includes a lightweight to-do list with prioritization to help
      minimize spread of app usage. It's one step better than a regular old
      to-do list, but not by much.
